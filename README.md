# Maze Bot

Maze Bot is a visual simulation tool for exploring and understanding pathfinding algorithms in a grid-based maze environment.

## Purpose

This simulation is designed to help users:
- **Visualize** how different pathfinding algorithms (BFS, DFS, A*) operate step by step.
- **Experiment** with maze layouts by placing or removing walls.
- **Learn** about algorithm efficiency, optimality, and behavior in various scenarios.
- **Compare** the results and performance of BFS, DFS, and A* on the same maze.

## Features

- Interactive grid for wall placement and maze generation.
- Visual feedback for visited cells, current path, and optimal path.
- UI controls for starting, resetting, and selecting algorithms.
- Status bar showing current action and simulation results.

## Who is it for?

- Students and educators learning about algorithms.
- Developers and enthusiasts interested in algorithm visualization.
- Anyone curious about how pathfinding works in games and robotics.
